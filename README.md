# Screen Recorder SDK
Library to take screenshots and record videos

We use [Desktop Duplication API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/direct3ddxgi/desktop-dup-api) to capture desktop and [Media Foundation API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/medfound/media-foundation-platform-apis) to record video.

*DDA works stable only for Windows >= 10 also you need 64bit Python*
